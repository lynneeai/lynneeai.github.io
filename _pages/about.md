I am a Ph.D. candidate at [SpeechLab](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/speech/lab.cgi) at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Julia Hirschberg](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/). I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from Columbia University and a Bachelor of Mathematics, with majors in Computer Science, Statistics, and Actuarial Science, from the University of Waterloo.

My research centers around NLP and information disorder, including misinformation detection, malicious intent analysis, and content analysis. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on LLM safety and alignment. Broadly, I am passionate about developing AI systems that prioritize ethical considerations and contribute to responsible AI deployment.
